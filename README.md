# Duplicate Remover
Deletes duplicates especially when filtering romsets/rompacks and you wanna remove duplicates or specific languages or files with specific keywords like "BETA" "Rev" "Japan" and etc.

# Duplicate Remover
Ever downloaded a romset or rompack where there's a lot of duplicates? You only want to play English games and want to remove other languages from the region of Japan,  Brazil, France, Europe and etc.?

Do you want to delete files with Beta, Alpha and Rev on their names but you have a thousand files ahead of you and your windows explorer search engine is functioning badly. Well this app was developed to counter these problems.

This maybe a simple app but the idea behind it was my struggle for filtering out files so I can play games on BATOCERA.

# How To Use Duplicate Remover
Browse the folder that you want to perform the operation on, then type the keyword that appears within the filename. For instance, if the filename contains the letters "US," only the files with "US" in their names will be shown and can be deleted. Remember that this app is not "Case Sensitive" meaning any file that has US in them will be deleted. So type the complete reference for example if it says (US) then type it with parenthesis.

For example you wanna delete games with Japanese language or games that came from that region. Inspect your file list first and if those game's filename says (Japan) or (JA) don't forget to add the parenthesis if it has (for example Super Mario Bros (Japan).zip) because it will definitely help you avoid accidents.

# Duplicate Remover Reversed
The application functions in reverse, displaying items that do not contain the keywords you searched for in their names. For instance, if you entered "US," the results will exhibit all files without "US" in their names. Additionally, the app operates in a case-insensitive manner.
