# DuplicateRemover
Deletes duplicates especially when filtering romsets/rompacks and you wanna remove duplicates or specific languages or files with specific keywords like "BETA" "Rev" "Japan" and etc.

# How
Ever downloaded a romset or rompack where there's a lot of duplicates? You only want to play English games and want to remove other languages from the region of Japan,  Brazil, France, Europe and etc.?

Do you want to delete files with Beta, Alpha and Rev on their names but you have a thousand files ahead of you and your windows explorer search engine is functioning badly. Well this app was developed to counter these problems.

This maybe a simple app but the idea behind it was my struggle for filtering out files so I can play games on BATOCERA.
